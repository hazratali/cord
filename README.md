# CORD Bibliographic Data Analysis
Code for analysis of bibliographic data to identify research gaps.
Identifying research gaps in scientific literature is of utmost importance. We propose a machine learning-based approach for identifying research gaps through the analysis of scientific literature. 

This is supplementary material for the paper __Alaa Ali Abd-alrazaq et al., "A Machine Learningâ€“Based Approach for Identifying Research Gaps: COVID-19 as a Case Study"__ (currently under review).

# Updated notebook (new)
All the code is combined and placed in the main notebook  
```
CORD_Bib_Analysis Final.ipynb
```
## Google Colab
The complete jupyter notebook is available as a Google Colab on the following link. It also shows the output graphs and topic visualizations.

## Dataset
The data used in this work was acquired from COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD) organized by the Allen Institute for AI, and available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). 

=================================

_The following parts are retained for review process and will be discarded after the review process is complete_

# Original Notebooks (old)
The code contains two Python/Jupyter notebooks.

The two notebooks are:
```
CORD Bib Analysis HA.ipynb
```
and
```
topic_modeling_BERTopic.ipynb
```

The topic modeling notebook generates the ```articles_with_topics.csv``` file.

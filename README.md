# CORD Bibiographic Data Analysis
Code for analysis of bibliographic data to identify research gaps
The code contains two Python/Jupyter notebooks.

The two notebooks are:
```
CORD Bib Analysis HA.ipynb
```
and
```
topic_modeling_BERTopic.ipynb
```

The topic modeling notebook generates the ```articles_with_topics.csv``` file.

# CORD Bibiographic Data Analysis
Code for analysis of bibliographic data to identify research gaps.
Identifying research gaps in scientific literature is of utmost importance. We propose a machine learning-based approach for identifying research gaps through the analysis of scientific literature. 

This is supplementary material for paper Alaa Ali Abd-alrazaq et al., "A Machine Learningâ€“Based Approach for Identifying Research Gaps: COVID-19 as a Case Study"

The code contains two Python/Jupyter notebooks.

The two notebooks are:
```
CORD Bib Analysis HA.ipynb
```
and
```
topic_modeling_BERTopic.ipynb
```

The topic modeling notebook generates the ```articles_with_topics.csv``` file.
